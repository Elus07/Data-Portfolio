# Retirement and Depression – IV Econometric Analysis

This project analyzes the causal effect of retirement on depression levels across European countries using SHARE panel data and advanced econometric methods.

# Objectives
- Estimate the impact of retirement on mental health
- Use eligibility age as an instrument to address endogeneity
- Compare OLS, Fixed Effects, and IV estimators

# Tools & Technologies
- STATA
- Panel data (144,000+ observations)
- Instrumental Variables (2SLS)
- Fixed Effects, robust standard errors

# Key Findings
- The baseline OLS regression appears to overestimate the negative effect of retirement on depression
- IV estimates suggest a statistically significant improvement in mental well-being after retirement, when accounting for endogeneity

# Files
- `retirement_iv.do` – main STATA script 
- `report.pdf` – project write-up and interpretation
- `plots/` – regression outputs and coefficient plots 

# Status
Coursework project in Applied Econometrics at Jönköping International Business School (MSc).
