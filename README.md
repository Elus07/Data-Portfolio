## Projects

### 1. **Salary Prediction and Economic Forecasting**  
*Python, OLS, ARIMA, VAR*  
Analyzed salary data using regression and created time series forecasts for macroeconomic indicators. Applied transformations, handled outliers and multicollinearity, and assessed model fit using MAE, RMSE, and R².

### 2. **The Economic Impact of Retirement on Depression**  
*STATA, OLS, Fixed Effects, IV, DiD*  
Used SHARE panel data to examine the causal effect of retirement on depression levels across European countries. Included rich econometric identification strategies like Instrumental Variables and Difference-in-Differences.

### 3. **Platform Economics – DiD Analysis**  
*Difference-in-Differences (DiD)*  
Evaluated the effect of platform policy changes on user behavior over time. Focused on the identification of causal impact using treatment and control groups.

### 4. **Spatial Analysis using QGIS & GeoDa**  
*Spatial statistics (Moran’s I, LISA)*  
Conducted exploratory spatial data analysis, identifying geographic clusters and patterns in socioeconomic indicators.

### 5. **Econometrics Coursework Projects**  
*OLS, Heteroskedasticity Tests, DiD*  
Hands-on coursework with simulated and real datasets. Analyzed education, labor markets, and firm-level data using econometric techniques.
