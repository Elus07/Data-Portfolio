# Twitter Platform Policy Change – Difference-in-Differences Analysis

This project evaluates the causal effect of Twitter’s platform policy change on user search behavior using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework. The analysis compares trends between a treatment group and a control group around the intervention date (April 14, 2022), supported by an event study.
