# Twitter Platform Policy Change – Difference-in-Differences Analysis

This project evaluates the causal effect of a major platform policy change on Twitter user search behavior using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework.

## Objectives
- Identify the impact of platform intervention on user activity
- Construct treatment and control groups
- Use DiD and event study to analyze behavior before and after the change

# Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Econometrics: Difference-in-Differences, Event Study
- Clustered standard errors

# Key Findings
- Search activity in the treatment group dropped significantly after the platform change
- Event study confirms timing alignment of the effect
- Placebo tests support the robustness of results

# Files
- `main.py` – main analysis script
- `data/` – structured input data (not public)
- `output/plots/` – event study and bar plot visuals
- `report.pdf` – full project write-up with results


# Status
Course project (has limitation as it was focused on DiD analysis), MSc Applied Economics (Platform Economics), Jönköping International Business School
