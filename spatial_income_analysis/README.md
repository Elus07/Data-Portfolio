# Spatial Analysis of Income in Swedish Municipalities

This project investigates the spatial distribution of income across Swedish municipalities using spatial statistics and econometric modeling.

# Objectives
- Identify spatial autocorrelation and clustering in income levels
- Apply Spatial Error Model to account for spatial dependence in regression residuals
- Interpret spatial patterns using GeoDa tools and statistical tests

# Tools & Technologies
- GeoDa
- QGIS
- Spatial econometrics (Moran’s I, LISA, Spatial Error Model)

# Key Findings
- Strong spatial autocorrelation detected (Moran’s I = 0.546)
- Spatial Error Model improved model fit compared to OLS
- Clusters of high-income and low-income municipalities identified across the country

## Files
- `report.pdf` – full write-up and analysis
- `plots/` – spatial maps and diagnostics from GeoDa
  

## Status
Spatial econometrics coursework project, Jönköping International Business School (MSc).
